GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. It's role is to inhibit or reduce neuronal activity, opposite of [[Glutamate]] When it's released into synapses, it bings to GABA receptors, causing the neuron's membrane to become more negative, decreasing the excitability by reducing the action potential. It plays a role in maintaining brain balance and prevents excessive neural activity that could lead to seizures, anxiety, etc. There are medications like [[benzodiazepines]] and barbiturates that enhance GABA's inhibitory effects and are used to treat anxiety, insomnia, etc.

Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a [[neurotransmitter]], a chemical messenger in your brain. It slows down your brain by blocking specific signals in your central nervous system. GABA is known for producing a calming effect and plays a role in controlling nerve cell hyperactivity associated with anxiety, stress, and fear². 

GABA is an **inhibitory** neurotransmitter⁴. When GABA attaches to a protein in your brain known as a GABA receptor, it produces a calming effect¹¹. This can help with feelings of anxiety, stress, and fear¹¹. It may also help to prevent seizures¹¹.

There are two types of GABA receptors on nerve cells — GABA-A and GABA-B¹⁸. Although they work in different ways, when GABA binds to these receptors the result is that they decrease the responsiveness of the nerve cell¹⁸. This means that as an inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA lessens the ability of a nerve cell to receive, create or send chemical messages to other nerve cells¹⁸.

GABA supplements are used to **lower stress, ease anxiety, and combat insomnia¹**. However, in *supplement form, only minimal amounts of GABA can actually cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB)* and have any effect on the brain⁴. 

Potential benefits of GABA include reducing stress, relieving anxiety, improving sleep, and lowering blood pressure⁶. GABA can also help with inflammation issues, which means it may provide relief for people with PMS or other conditions that come with chronic pain³. Active people may find that GABA helps with recovery and may increase exercise tolerance³.

However, there are some side effects associated with GABA. These include dizziness, anxiety, drowsiness, dry mouth, and balance problems¹³. Other side effects may include gastrointestinal distress, headache, nausea, reduced appetite, constipation, burning throat, and drowsiness or sleepiness¹².

GABA supplements are available in the market⁷. However, it's important to note that dietary supplements are not regulated like drugs in the United States, meaning the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not approve them for safety and effectiveness before products are marketed⁴. Therefore, it's essential to talk to your healthcare provider about any supplements you plan to take and check in about potential interactions with other supplements or medications⁴.
