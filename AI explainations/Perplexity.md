## what is dexamphetamine
Dexamphetamine, also known as dextroamphetamine, is a potent central nervous system (CNS) stimulant and an enantiomer of amphetamine. It is used in the medical field primarily for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy[1][4][5][8]. 

Dexamphetamine works by changing the amounts of certain natural substances in the brain, helping to increase the ability to pay attention, stay focused on an activity, and control behavior problems. It may also help to organize tasks and improve listening skills[3][6]. 

The drug is available in various forms, including tablets, capsules, and liquid, and can be taken with or without food. It is available as both a brand name and generic drug[1][3][4]. 

Despite its therapeutic uses, dexamphetamine has a potential for abuse and can be habit-forming. Misuse or abuse of amphetamines may cause serious heart and blood pressure problems. If used for a long time, dependence may develop, and withdrawal symptoms may occur after stopping the drug[3][6]. 

In addition to its approved uses, dexamphetamine has been used off-label for conditions such as cerebrovascular accidents[2]. It is also used recreationally as an aphrodisiac and euphoriant, and as an athletic performance and cognitive enhancer[4]. 

It's important to note that using dexamphetamine without a prescription from a doctor, psychiatrist, or pediatrician, or selling or giving it to someone else is illegal[5].

## whats the difference between it and amphetamine

Amphetamine and dexamphetamine (also known as dextroamphetamine) are both central nervous system stimulants used primarily for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. They share many similarities but also have some key differences[1][2][3][4][5].

Amphetamine is a mixture of two enantiomers: dextroamphetamine (d-amphetamine) and levoamphetamine (l-amphetamine). Dextroamphetamine, on the other hand, consists only of the d-amphetamine enantiomer[1][2][3]. 

The primary difference between the two lies in their pharmacological effects. Amphetamine triggers the release of both dopamine and norepinephrine, while dextroamphetamine primarily triggers the release of dopamine[1]. This difference in neurotransmitter release can lead to slightly different effects and side effects between the two drugs.

Dextroamphetamine is generally considered to be more potent than amphetamine. This is because dextroamphetamine is the more active enantiomer of amphetamine, and it is not "diluted" by the presence of levoamphetamine, which is less potent[4][5]. 

In terms of formulations, while dextroamphetamine is typically available only as a capsule, amphetamine is available as both a tablet and an extended-release capsule[1]. 

It's important to note that the body processes the chemicals in each drug differently, so switching between different amphetamine and dextroamphetamine preparations is not recommended[1]. 

Despite these differences, both amphetamine and dextroamphetamine have a potential for abuse and can be habit-forming. Misuse or abuse of these drugs can lead to serious health problems, including heart and blood pressure issues[1][4][5].

## Make a comprehensive overlook on the mechanism of action of Dextroamphetamine

[Dextroamphetamine, a potent central nervous system (CNS) stimulant, works by changing the amounts of certain natural substances in the brain](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a605027.html)[1](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a605027.html). [It elicits its stimulating effects via several distinct actions](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a605027.html)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextroamphetamine)[3](https://tmedweb.tulane.edu/pharmwiki/doku.php/dextroamphetamine):

1. [**Inhibition or Reversal of Transporter Proteins**: Dextroamphetamine inhibits or reverses the transporter proteins for the monoamine neurotransmitters, namely the serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine transporters](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a605027.html)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextroamphetamine). [This action can occur either via trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) or in a TAAR1 independent fashion when there are high cytosolic concentrations of the monoamine neurotransmitters](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a605027.html)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextroamphetamine).
    
2. [**Release of Neurotransmitters**: It releases these neurotransmitters from synaptic vesicles via vesicular monoamine transporter 2](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a605027.html)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextroamphetamine).
    
3. [**Increase in Monoamine Release**: Dextroamphetamine increases the release of monoamines (norepinephrine, 5-HT, and dopamine) from their vesicular storage sites within presynaptic nerve terminals](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a605027.html)[3](https://tmedweb.tulane.edu/pharmwiki/doku.php/dextroamphetamine).
    
4. [**Competition with Monoamines**: It competes with monoamines for reuptake via NET, DAT, and SERT with the selectivity pattern NET>DAT»SERT](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a605027.html)[3](https://tmedweb.tulane.edu/pharmwiki/doku.php/dextroamphetamine).
    

[By altering the balance of these neurotransmitters, dextroamphetamine can help increase attention and decrease impulsiveness and hyperactivity in patients with ADHD](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a605027.html)[1](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a605027.html). Please note that this is a simplified explanation and the actual mechanism of action is complex and involves multiple pathways in the brain. Always consult with a healthcare professional for more detailed information.

## research on Piracetam
Piracetam is a drug that was developed in the 1960s³. It is a [[nootropic]], a type of drug used to **enhance memory, learning, and other cognitive functions³⁸**. It is also used as a treatment for myoclonus¹⁴, a condition characterized by sudden, involuntary jerking of a muscle or group of muscles⁴. 

Piracetam is part of the racetams group and is a cyclic **derivative of the neurotransmitter [[GABA]]¹⁴**. However, its mechanism of action differs from that of endogenous [[GABA]]¹⁴. It is thought to help cells in the brain and blood vessels function better²⁴. During aging and in some diseases, the membrane that surrounds cells starts to get stiff. Cells with a stiff membrane do not function as well. Some scientists think that piracetam helps maintain the membrane that surrounds cells so that they continue to function well²⁴.

In terms of its uses, piracetam is **most commonly used for** **epilepsy**, **dizziness**, **dyslexia**, and tardive dyskinesia². It is also used for **dementia**, **schizophrenia**, **sickle cell disease**, etc, but there is **no good scientific evidence to support many of these uses²**.

The effectiveness of piracetam varies. Some research shows that taking piracetam for 2-3 months helps to reduce breath-holding spells in young children². It also seems to improve some reading skills in children aged 7-14 years with dyslexia²⁸. However, the evidence to support its use for many conditions is unclear²[^10^].

As for **side effects**, piracetam has been observed to cause hyperkinesia, weight gain, nervousness, somnolence, depression, and asthenia¹. Other common **side effects include diarrhea, drowsiness, insomnia, nervousness, depression, and muscle spasm⁵**. Some people may also experience adverse effects, **including depression, agitation, tiredness, dizziness, insomnia, anxiety, headaches, nausea, paranoia, and diarrhea⁸**.

In terms of legality, piracetam is an uncontrolled substance in the United States, meaning it is legal to possess without a license or prescription¹¹²¹³. However, its use in food, supplements, medical devices, insecticides, infant formula, cosmetics, animal feed, animal drugs, tobacco products, and drugs is unlawful and constitutes an act of misbranding¹¹²¹³. It is not approved by the FDA for any medical or dietary use³⁴.
