is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain. 

It has the opposite role of [[GABA]], and increases neuronal activity and promotes action potentials

It's involved in learning, memory, cognition, etc. 

Excessive glutamate activity can be harmful and is associated with conditions like excitotoxicity, which occurs when neurons are overstimulated and damaged. It's involved in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's
