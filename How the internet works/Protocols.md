They are a set or rules and conventions that define how data is transmitted and recieved over a network. They ensure reliable, efficient. and secure communication between different devices and systems. 

Reason: establishing a connection between two computers which may operate on different hardware and software necessitates an agreed upon format that all devices understand. These protocols ensure interoperability among diverse systems and seamless data transfer. 

Such protocols include 
	Ethernet     (for sending packets between devices on the same network)
	[[Internet Protocol]] (IPv4, IPv6)     (for sending packets from network to network)
	[[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP)     for ensuring the packets successfully arrive in order)
	[[UDP]]
	[[HTTP]]/S      (for formatting data for websites and applications)
	FTP
	SFT
