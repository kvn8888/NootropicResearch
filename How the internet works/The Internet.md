is a collection of networks, a group of connected computers that can send data to each other. So we can think of it as interconnected networks

The physical architecture of the internet (networking infrastructure) include wires, cables, radio waves, etc. They carry bits that can be deserialized by the receiving computer. 

Because the internet is not centralized, the system is not dependent on any individual machine. Any device can connect and disconnect to the internet without impacting reliability. 

[[Packets]] and [[protocols]] are fundamental to how the internet functions.
