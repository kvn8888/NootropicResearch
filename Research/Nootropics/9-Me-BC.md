is a research chemical of the β-carboline family. It's structurally similar to beta carbolines like [[harmine]] and [[harmane]]. It inhibits [[monoamine oxidase]], antioxidant activity, and neuroprotection. It's legal in every country and sold as a dietary supplement. It can be useful for depression as monoamine oxidase breaks down serotonin. It regenerates dead dopaminergic neurons and restores dopamine levels

It's considered safe with an animal study with 9-Me-BC administered for 10 days. But avoid eating high tyramine containing foods.

It works by stimulating neurons and promoting their growth. 
It can help with **focus**, **memory**, **mood**, and **brain health**. [Anecdotal evidence from a reddit user claims that it boosted their confidence greatly, and helps them manage social anxiety. But a dose greater than 30mg led to a noticeable increase in anxiety and irritability](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/dny54e/9mebc_review/)

It is a methylated derivative of β-carboline. It has been shown to increase the expression of tyrosine hydroxylate and associated transcription factors, increase neurite outgrowth, and regenerate neurons after chronic rotenone administration 

Can be stacked with Sulbutiamine, [[Piracetam]], [[Alpha GPC]]

**Side effects**
photosensitivity and dopamine neurotoxicity when 9-Me-BC exceeds maximum recommended dosages.
