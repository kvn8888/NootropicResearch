Combination of Dexamphetamine ([[Dextroamphetamine]]) and [[Amphetamine]]. 

Dextroamphetamine and amphetamine are potent CNS stimulants and dextroamphetamine is a enantiomer **(mirror image) of amphetamine**. 
Used to tread ADHD and narcolepsy. It can also be used as an **athletic performance** and **cognitive enhancer**. Can be taken recreationally as an **aphrodisiac** and **euphoriant**. It has a high risk of abuse and addiction. 

It has a time to peak concentration of 60 to 160 minutes and metabolized in the liver. The half life is 10 to 12 hours. 

Improves focus and reduces impulsive behavior. 
When used at lower doses, dextroamphetamine produces improvements in cognition, working memory, and attention. It may also improve the motivation to perform tasks, and increase wakefulness. It restores cognitive performance and alertness degraded by sleep loss and has a similar duration of action to [[modafinil]].
Improvements are shown in reaction time and endurance primarily through dopamine inhibition. 

**Side effects** can include **anxiety**, **false sense of well being**, insomnia, anorexia, and nausea. **Serious side effects can include stoke**, **heart attack**, or **sudden death** in certain people. Can cause blurred vision and may impair reactions. 
It can increase heart rate and blood pressure. 

## mechanism of action of amphetamines

Inhibition or reversal of transporter proteins. The Dextroamphetamine inhibits or reverses the transporter proteins for the monoamine neurotransmitters (serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine)

It increases the concentration of dopamine and norepinephrine. 

Inhibition of serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine transporters can occur via TAAR1 or when there are high cytosolic concentrations of monoamine neurotransmitters

Bing: *It releases these neurotransmitters from synaptic vesicles via vesicular monoamine transporter*

Amphetamine increases neurotransmitter levels my stimulating their release from neurons and blocking their reuptake. 

Amphetamine inhibits [[monoamine oxidase]], an enzyme that breaks down these monoamine neurotransmitters
