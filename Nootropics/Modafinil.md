Modafinil is a non amphetamine CNS stimulant/wakefulness medication (FDA Approved) to treat sleep apnea, narcolepsy, and shift work sleep disorder. It produces a similar level of wakefulness to amphetamine, however, more sustained and continuous. 

It matched Dextroamphetamine's and Ritalin's (methylphenidate) effectiveness in ADHD in small trials [1]

modafinil exhibited a substantial placebo effect on outcomes such as fatigue, excessive sleepiness, and depression but did not offer greater benefits than placebo. [1]

**Mechanism of action**
Early research suggests that modafinil has a weak affinity for dopamine receptors and does not stimulate dopamine release directly. Some studies show that modafinil at various doses and routes lead to increased extracellular levels of dopamine in the prefrontal cortexes in rats. It inhibits dopamine transport, which means more dopamine stays in the brain. However, dopamine antagonists did not suppress modafinil induced effects. [1]

Modafinil does not bind to adrenergic (adrenaline/[[epinephrine]] and norepinephrine) [[receptors]] at regular doses. It does not appear to affect the firing rate in noradrenergic neurons, which implies it does not directly stimulate or inhibit the activity of these neurons. However, modafinil has been shown to increase levels of noradrenaline in the [[prefrontal cortex]] and medial [[hypothalamus]]. 
[[VLPO]] (Ventrolateral Preoptic) Neurons play a role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. When they're activated, they signal the brain to enter a state of sleep. Noradrenaline has stimulatory effects and promotes alertness, however when noradrenaline interacts with neurons like those in VLPO, they can suppress their activity. 

However, the action of modafinil is not blocked in mice treated with a toxin that destroys norepinephrine pathways, which suggests that noradrenergic pathways involved in noradrenergic signaling, are not crucial for modafinil's effects. However, when mice are treated with However, when the mice were pretreated with quinpirole (which suppresses dopamine release) or terazosin (which blocks a type of adrenoceptor), the action of Modafinil was blocked. This suggests that Modafinil's effects may depend on dopamine stimulating adrenergic receptors. 

Summary: [[Dopamine]] reuptake inhibition (by binding to the dopamine reuptake pump) leading to an increase of extracellular dopamine, activation of Glutamatergic Circuits and the inhibition of [[GABA]], increases [[Orexin]] and [[Histamine]] neurons. The activation of orexin neurons is associated with psychoactivation and euphoria. 
Modafinil may impact other neurotransmitter systems such as [[Norepinephrine]], [[Serotonin]], and [[Glutamate]]
