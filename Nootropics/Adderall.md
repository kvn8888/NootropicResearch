Combination of Dexamphetamine ([[Dextroamphetamine]]) and [[Amphetamine]]. 

**Dexamphetamine**:
Dexamphetamine, also known as dextroamphetamine, is a potent central nervous system (CNS) stimulant and an enantiomer of amphetamine. It is used in the medical field primarily for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy[1][4][5][8]. 

Dexamphetamine works by changing the amounts of certain natural substances in the brain, helping to increase the ability to pay attention, stay focused on an activity, and control behavior problems. It may also help to organize tasks and improve listening skills[3][6]. 

The drug is available in various forms, including tablets, capsules, and liquid, and can be taken with or without food. It is available as both a brand name and generic drug[1][3][4]. 

Despite its therapeutic uses, dexamphetamine has a potential for abuse and can be habit-forming. Misuse or abuse of amphetamines may cause serious heart and blood pressure problems. If used for a long time, dependence may develop, and withdrawal symptoms may occur after stopping the drug[3][6]. 

In addition to its approved uses, dexamphetamine has been used off-label for conditions such as cerebrovascular accidents[2]. It is also used recreationally as an aphrodisiac and euphoriant, and as an athletic performance and cognitive enhancer[4]. 

It's important to note that using dexamphetamine without a prescription from a doctor, psychiatrist, or pediatrician, or selling or giving it to someone else is illegal[5].

Amphetamine and dexamphetamine (also known as dextroamphetamine) are both central nervous system stimulants used primarily for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. They share many similarities but also have some key differences[1][2][3][4][5].

Amphetamine is a mixture of two enantiomers: dextroamphetamine (d-amphetamine) and levoamphetamine (l-amphetamine). Dextroamphetamine, on the other hand, consists only of the d-amphetamine enantiomer[1][2][3]. 

The primary difference between the two lies in their pharmacological effects. Amphetamine triggers the release of both dopamine and norepinephrine, while dextroamphetamine primarily triggers the release of dopamine[1]. This difference in neurotransmitter release can lead to slightly different effects and side effects between the two drugs.

Dextroamphetamine is generally considered to be more potent than amphetamine. This is because dextroamphetamine is the more active enantiomer of amphetamine, and it is not "diluted" by the presence of levoamphetamine, which is less potent[4][5]. 

In terms of formulations, while dextroamphetamine is typically available only as a capsule, amphetamine is available as both a tablet and an extended-release capsule[1]. 

It's important to note that the body processes the chemicals in each drug differently, so switching between different amphetamine and dextroamphetamine preparations is not recommended[1]. 

Despite these differences, both amphetamine and dextroamphetamine have a potential for abuse and can be habit-forming. Misuse or abuse of these drugs can lead to serious health problems, including heart and blood pressure issues[1][4][5].
