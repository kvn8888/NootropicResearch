is a research chemical of the β-carboline family that can be found in exogenous and endogenous sources, similar to insulin. It's structurally similar to beta carbolines like [[harmine]] and [[harmane]]. Recent studies have shown it's neurostimulative, neuroprotective, and neuroregenerative, and includes anti-inflammatory effects. The chemical has been shown to increase neurite outgrowth of dopaminergic neurons independent of their dopamine reuptake

It's legal in every country and sold as a dietary supplement. It's considered safe based on animal studies where 9-Me-BC was administered for 10 days.

It works by stimulating neurons and promoting their growth. 
It can help with **focus**, **memory**, **mood**, and **brain health**. [Anecdotal evidence from a reddit user claims that it boosted their confidence greatly, and helps them manage social anxiety. But a dose greater than 30mg led to a noticeable increase in anxiety and irritability](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/dny54e/9mebc_review/)

It is a methylated derivative of β-carboline. It has been shown to increase the expression of tyrosine hydroxylate and associated transcription factors, increase neurite outgrowth, and regenerate neurons after chronic rotenone administration. It inhibits [[monoamine oxidase]]. 

Can be stacked with Sulbutiamine, [[Piracetam]], [[Alpha GPC]]

**Side effects**
photosensitivity and dopamine neurotoxicity when 9-Me-BC exceeds maximum recommended dosages.
